# Automatic Anti-Flying Defense System (AAFDS)

## Introduction
In this project I am going to make a system that automatically detects flying bugs and brings them down. This will help the user, because the system would prevent the user to be stung by mosquitoes and be anoyed by flies.

## User stories
- **As a user** I do not want to manually reload the system too often, so that I can leave the system on overnight or when I am not around.
- **As a user** I want the system to automatically bring any flying bugs down, so that I can relax and do not have to chase down these bugs myself.
- **As a user** I want to be able to turn on or off the system by flicking a switch, so that I do not have to remove the batteries from the sytem by hand.
- **As a client** I want the system to be easy to assemble, so that I can quickly produce a big quantity of the system.
- **As a client** I want to reduce the production cost of the system, so that I can increase the profit margin on the system.
