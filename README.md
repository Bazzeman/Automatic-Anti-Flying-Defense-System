# Project Physical Computing - Final Project
You will work alone or in a team of 2 students.
In this project you will work on a physical computing project to show what you learned so far.

## Collect proof of work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Photo of the end result.
* Video's of tests.
* Technical design (Tinkercad, WokWi, ...).
* ...

## General planning
15 lessons of 3 hours each.

## Phases of the project
Make sure you loop through these phases during the project:

### Proposal 
You are your own client. So you can write your own proposal. \
The language used should be understandable for a client \
(use the `PROPOSAL.md` file in the `sintlucas` folder).

Describe the problem you want to solve:
 * The product should be a physical computing product.
 * Combine components you've learned about so far.
 * The behaviour should be intelligent and meaningful.
 * Focus on originality and usability.

Describe the requirements of the product as user stories (As a ... I want ... so that ...).

*Inspiration*:
* Musical instrument
* Light instrument
* Escape-room puzzle (like MasterSafe)
* Two-player game, competitive or cooperative
* Smart creature, intelligent/reactive
* Intelligent machine, task-driven
* Wearables
* Kinetic (moving) art

### Technical design
Create a technical design in TinkerCad (or WokWi) and save a screenshot in the `sintlucas` folder.

### User Interface design
Create a user interface design (drawing) and save a screenshot in the `sintlucas` folder.

## Prepare
* Write down the Issues (user stories) in `GitHub Issues` (which will act as your backlog).
* Use the MoSCoW method to prioritize the backlog items (M: Must have, S: Should have, C: Could have, W: Won't have).
* Create a Scrum Board in GitHub Projects.
* Refine each item into smaller, more technical items (this is called the sprint planning).
* Place just enough refined items in the Scrum Board in the ToDo column (this is called the sprint backlog).
  Enough means that you can finish all items in the sprint.
 
## Realise: development
* Start each lesson with a stand-up meeting:
  * Open the scrum board
  * Every team member answers these questions:
    * What did you do last time?
    * What will you do today?
    * Are there any impediments in your way?
* Start developing on the sprint backlog items (ToDo).

Don't forget:
* Pull the changes of your team members regularly.
* Commit and push your changes regularly to prevent merge conflicts.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.

## Test
* Think beforehand how you will test your application/product.
* Make video's/photos of the tests.

## Feedback and feedforward
* During development, you will get a review and a retrospective with one of the teachers.
* During the last lesson you will present the results to the other teams.
* The teacher will evaluate your work (see the file `SD - Feedback en feedforward door docent`). 
  * Your designs are in line with the requirements (6).
  * The issues have been refined into smaller, more technical items (8).
  * The final product is in line with the designs (9).
  * You can argue why you made certain choices (9).
  * The product runs smooth and is bug free (10).
  * The code is clean, readable and follows code conventions (11).
  * The product has been tested (12).
  * You can evaluate the process and are open to feedback (16).
